Explanation:
CarPart: Represents a generic car part with a method checkService() that defines the service criteria for that part.
EnginePart and BatteryPart: Subclasses of CarPart representing specific types of car parts (e.g., engine, battery).
CapuletPart, SternmanPart, WilloughbyPart, and NubbinPart: Subclasses of specific car parts representing different car models.
Each specific car part subclass will implement its own version of checkService() method according to the service criteria specific to that part and car model.
